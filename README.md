# Resources for GRE Preparation

All these links work as of July 2023.

- Some things have been inherited from [this repo](https://github.com/AmoghDabholkar/GRE_PREP/tree/master).
- A list by Rice University: [here](https://oaa.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs3031/files/inline-files/GRE%20Free%20Prep%20Resources.pdf).
- There are 60 essays in the write-ups folder: Some may not be completed, while others may have non-ETS topics.
- Would recommend AWA practice only using topics from the official pool.
